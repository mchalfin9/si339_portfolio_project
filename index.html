    <p> Hi, are you interested in Golf, maybe due to the pandemic? If yes, you are in the right spot. I started playing golf when I was
        a junior in high school, so roughly 4-5 years ago, and it happened in a unique way. In the spring season of high school, I used to play lacrosse, but I did't enjoy it much
        and the team was not good in terms of talent. So, I was looking for maybe something else to do then that and one of my friends told
        me to try out for the golf team. I played hockey my entire life and knew there was a correlation, so I said why not. I borrowed my friends clubs 
        and I ended up making the team. From then on I loved the sport and my passion for the game has grown ever since. </p><br><p>
        Throughout my high school golf career, I was lucky enough to be able to experience a lot of very nice golf courses in Westchester County, New York, which I took for granted. Nonetheless, my golf experience 
        in high school and after has allowed me to play the sport I now love all over the country and experience different designs and conditions.</p><br><p>Within the site, I wanted to
        demostrate my passion and give a look into golf courses that I have played and my opinions about them along with courses that I hope to one day experience. Click through and enjoy!</p>
